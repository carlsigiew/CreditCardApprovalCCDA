# CreditCardApprovalCCDA
### Project Scope and Business Goal:

**Project Scope:**
The project aims to develop a machine learning model for credit card approval prediction, leveraging both traditional logistic regression and advanced algorithms like Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. The focus is on assessing the credit risk of applicants based on historical data and personal information. The goal is to enhance the credit scoring process, balancing transparency and predictive power.

**Domain:**
The project operates in the financial industry, specifically in credit risk assessment for credit card applications. Key characteristics include the use of historical data, economic sensitivity, and the need for transparent decision-making. Stakeholders in this domain include financial institutions, regulators, and credit applicants.

**Literature Review:**
The literature review encompasses research papers, case studies, articles, and books related to credit scoring in the financial industry. Relevant topics include the application of logistic regression, machine learning algorithms, and the trade-off between transparency and complexity in credit scoring models. At least five current sources are reviewed and summarized to stay informed about advancements and best practices.

**Data Source(s):**
Potential data sources for this project include credit card application databases, APIs providing economic indicators, public credit datasets, and data specifically collected for this project. The availability, nature, and quality of data are critical considerations for model training and validation.

### Challenges while choosing the domain and choosing the dataset:

**Domain-specific Challenges:**
In the financial domain, challenges include regulatory compliance, ethical considerations, and potential biases in the data. Privacy is a paramount concern, and adherence to regulations such as GDPR and financial data protection laws must be ensured. Handling imbalanced datasets and avoiding discriminatory biases in the credit scoring process are additional challenges.

**KPIâ€™s:**
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will play a crucial role in evaluating the success of the credit scoring model. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and possibly ROC-AUC will be considered. The choice of KPIs will be aligned with the goals of the financial industry, emphasizing the importance of correctly identifying creditworthy applicants while minimizing the risk of defaults. The KPIs will set the stage for optimizing the models and ensuring they meet industry standards and expectations.
