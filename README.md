# CreditCardApprovalCCDA
### Project Scope and Business Goal:

**Project Scope:**
The project aims to develop a machine learning model for credit card approval prediction, leveraging Amazon Sagemaker and it's ability to test out multiple models and pick the best one. The focus is on assessing the credit risk of applicants based on historical data and personal information. The goal is to enhance the credit scoring process, balancing transparency and predictive power and create an application that credit card approvers can use to quickly sift through applicants.

**Domain:**
The project operates in the financial industry, specifically in credit risk assessment for credit card applications. Key characteristics include the use of historical data, economic sensitivity, and the need for transparent decision-making. Stakeholders in this domain include financial institutions, regulators, and credit applicants.

**Literature Review:**
The literature review encompasses research papers, case studies, articles, and books related to credit scoring in the financial industry. Relevant topics include the application of logistic regression, machine learning algorithms, and the trade-off between transparency and complexity in credit scoring models. At least five current sources are reviewed and summarized to stay informed about advancements and best practices.

**Data Source(s):**
The dataset used for this project is one from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction). This is a highly reviewed data set where the data has been masked to protect the individual's privacy and data. 

**Domain-specific Challenges:**
In the financial domain, challenges include regulatory compliance, ethical considerations, and potential biases in the data. Privacy is a paramount concern, and adherence to regulations such as GDPR and financial data protection laws must be ensured. Handling imbalanced datasets and avoiding discriminatory biases in the credit scoring process are additional challenges. The dataset also needs to include a balanced amount of data in order to cover all the possible cases.

**KPIâ€™s:**
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will play a crucial role in evaluating the success of the credit scoring model. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and possibly ROC-AUC will be considered. The choice of KPIs will be aligned with the goals of the financial industry, emphasizing the importance of correctly identifying creditworthy applicants while minimizing the risk of defaults. The KPIs will set the stage for optimizing the models and ensuring they meet industry standards and expectations.
